The purpose for this repo is to have simple reference proyect for various technologies, just in case one of the has not been used in some time, of to quickly start developing using them as a template of shorts.

So far there are mostly references to technologies I have worked with (spring and struts), but others are on the way.

Sample reference projects are:

* spring_core: Shows the basic spring proyect layout, bean usage and wiring.
* spring_ws_rest: Basic restful webservice using spring.
* spring_hibernate: Integration between spring and hibernate. Requires mysql to test.
* spring_mvc: Shows an example of jsp-controller and how to work with views.
* struts_basic: Quite similar to spring_mvc, but using the somewhat simpler struts framework.
* jsf_basic: Very basic, project setup and little else, as jsf is something I haven't worked with, yet.

TODO:
* Create web references: So far "botnet" repository can be checked for some things involving angular, node..., but a specific reference project directory would be nice to avoid having to look around...
* GWT: Google web toolkit is another framework I haven't worked with, so some work here would be nice.
* Groovy on Grails: Same as GWT...
